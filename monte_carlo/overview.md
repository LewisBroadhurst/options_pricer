# Monte-Carlo Simulations
Probabilistic approach to a problem.
vs. deterministic.

Can estimate the possible outcomes of certain events.
Generate several possible outcomes and then calculate the average of these outcomes.
More iterations, the better the prediction.

Create 1000s of simulations.
From these can take the mean of the simulations to predict the path (or stock price) with the highest probability.

### Stochastic
Stochastic is the property of being well-described by a random probability distribution.
Stochasticity and randomness are distinct, in that the former refers to a modeling approach and the latter 
refers to phenomena; these terms are often used synonymously.
